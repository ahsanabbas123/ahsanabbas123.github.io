Hi! I am Ahsan. I am a third year student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, majoring in Computer Science. I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision for Healthcare.

I most recently got the Future Research Talent Award of $6000AUD by Australian National University to work at the [Clear Vision Research Group](https://www.clearvisionresearch.com/) under [Dr. Riccardo Natoli](https://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/people/academics/dr-riccardo-natoli) 
(Postponed due to COVID19 :()

I am currently working on making a mobile application for Cervical Cancer diagnosis and low-cost Colposcopic examinations at the Machine Vision Laboratory, CEERI-Pilani under [Dr. J L Raheja](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/j-l-raheja/). 
 
I interned at [Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology](https://www.igib.res.in/) after my second year, a research centre of [Council of Scientific and Industrial Research](https://www.csir.res.in/), where I worked on a implementing an entropy based distance metric between indiviuals for their phenotypic profiles. I also worked on zebrafish videos to create a bounding box for their heart and plot variations to estimate their heartbeat.
