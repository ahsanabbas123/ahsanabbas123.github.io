<img class="profile-picture" src="dp.jpg">

Hi! I am Ahsan. I am a third year student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, majoring in Computer Science. I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing for Healthcare.

I most recently got selected for the Future Research Talent Award - $6000AUD by Australian National University to work at [Clear Vision Research Group](https://www.clearvisionresearch.com/) under [Dr. Riccardo Natoli](https://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/people/academics/dr-riccardo-natoli) 

I am currently working on making a decision support system mobile application for Cervical Cancer diagnosis and easier colposcopic examinations at the Machine Vision Laboratory, CEERI-Pilani. 
 
I interned at [Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology](https://www.igib.res.in/) after my second year, a research centre of [Council of Scientific and Industrial Research](https://www.csir.res.in/), where I worked on a implementing a entropy based distance metric between indiviuals according to their phenotypic profiles. I also worked on zebrafish videos to create a bounding box for their heart and plot variations to estimate thier heartbeat.
