Hi! I am Ahsan. I am a 4th year student at BITS Pilani, majoring in CS. I interned at Microsoft Azure last summer and worked on a Cloud Observability API that collects and replays data from components such as elasticsearch, grafana, kibana and jaeger from one cluster to another. 

I am broadly interested in applications of NLP. I also like to solve Competitive Programming questions in C++. I have interned under at The University of Manchester, and worked on applying NLP on clinical reports and am currently working on visual question answering at the Web Intelligence Lab at BITS Pilani.

I got the Future Research Talent Award of $6000AUD by Australian National University to work at the [Clear Vision Research Group](https://www.clearvisionresearch.com/) under Dr. Riccardo Natoli.
(Post-poned due to COVID19)

In the summer of 2019, I interned at [Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology](https://www.igib.res.in/) where I worked on a implementing an entropy based distance metric between indiviuals for their phenotypic profiles. I have also implemented an object detection model for low-cost Colposcopic examinations at the Machine Vision Laboratory, CEERI-Pilani under [Dr. J L Raheja](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/j-l-raheja/).
