Hi! I am Ahsan. I am a 4th year student at BITS Pilani, majoring in CS. I will be joining Microsoft as a Software Engineering Intern next summer.  

I am broadly interested in NLP and Machine Reading Comprehension tasks. I also like to solve Competitive Programming questions in C++. I have interned under at The University of Manchester, and worked on applying NLP on clinical reports and am currently working on visual question answering at the Web Intelligence Lab at BITS Pilani.

I got the Future Research Talent Award of $6000AUD by Australian National University to work at the [Clear Vision Research Group](https://www.clearvisionresearch.com/) under [Dr. Riccardo Natoli](https://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/people/academics/dr-riccardo-natoli) 
(Post-poned due to COVID19)

In the summer of 2019, I interned at [Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology](https://www.igib.res.in/) where I worked on a implementing an entropy based distance metric between indiviuals for their phenotypic profiles. I have also implemented an object detection model for low-cost Colposcopic examinations at the Machine Vision Laboratory, CEERI-Pilani under [Dr. J L Raheja](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/j-l-raheja/).
